Description: Heterogeneity in MR analyses can arise due to horizontal pleiotropy. This package uses MR-Base to identify possible traits that can explain the heterogeneity, with a view to identifying novel putative associations, and adjusting for their influences to reduce heterogeneity and improve power.
