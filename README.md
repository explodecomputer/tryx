# Treasure your exceptions (TRYX)

## To Do

### Plot

- categorise traits
- print SNP names or gene names
- option to have no names

### Scan

- Implement cooks distance as option for finding outliers
- Implement MR PRESSO as option for finding outliers

### Scan output

- calculate significant associations (currently in plot function - should remove from here)

### Analysis

- Simulate improvement in multiple testing correction when filtering by outlier associations
