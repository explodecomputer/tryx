\usage{
tryx.scan(dat, outliers = "RadialMR",
  outlier_threshold = 0.05/sum(subset(dat, id.exposure == id.exposure[1] &
  id.outcome == id.outcome[1])$mr_keep), use_proxies = FALSE,
  search_threshold = 5e-08, id_list = "default", include_outliers = FALSE,
  mr_method = "mr_ivw")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Output from harmonise_data. Note - only the first id.exposure - id.outcome pair will be used}

\item{outliers}{Default is to use the RadialMR package to identify IVW outliers. Alternatively can providen an array of SNP names that are present in dat$SNP to use as outliers}

\item{outlier_threshold}{The p-value to be used as threshold for detecting outliers, if outliers="RadialMR". Default is 0.05/nsnp.}

\item{use_proxies}{Whether to use proxies when looking up associations. FALSE by default for speed}

\item{search_threshold}{The p-value threshold for detecting an association between an outlier and a candidate trait. Default is 5e-8}

\item{id_list}{The list of trait IDs to search through for candidate associations. The default is the high priority traits in available_outcomes()}

\item{include_outliers}{When performing MR of candidate traits against exposures or outcomes, whether to include the original outlier SNP. Default is FALSE.}

\item{mr_method}{Method to use for candidate trait - exposure/outcome analysis. Default is mr_ivw. Can also provide basic MR methods e.g. mr_weighted_mode, mr_weighted_median etc. Also possible to use "strategy1" which performs IVW in the first instance, but then weighted mode for associations with high heterogeneity.}

\description{
A simple wrapper function.
Using a summary set, find outliers in the MR analysis between the pair of trais.
Find other 'candidate traits' associated with those outliers.
Perform MR of each of those candidate traits with the original exposure and outcome
